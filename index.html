        <h3>Welcome to my bash scripts collection.</h3>

<p>This a collection of my bash scripts. Some of them are written for personal use, so they're adapted to my needs, feel free to modify them. </p>


<h3>backup.sh</h3>

<p>It was my backup script for a while. Quite simple, just some rsync over different folders, with logs. But in my case I had first to mount my device.</p>

<h3>getip.sh</h3>

<p>Obtain ips from given domains. With google reader support. Three modes of execution: </p>
<ul>
	<li>1. Single url. Type a single url and return its ip</li>
	<li>2. Url file. Several urls stored in a file (one per line)</li>
	<li>3. OPML File (Exported from Google Reader). Maybe the most interesting. Type the path of the .opml file, and it will generate a file with all ips. This may take a while</li>
</ul>



<h3>remote_access.sh</h3>

<p> There's two version of  this script, to fill my needs. Using nmap, it scans all your network looking for online hosts. Syncs some folders and then send a shutdown command.</p>

<h3>reset-nic.sh</h3>
<p>During this course, in class we created a lot of VMs, which gave us a lot of problems with network cards, because we had a "clean" machine, and then we make clones and clones, so NICs problems arised eventually. Duplicated NICs, too many eth's, etc etc. With this script you may solve those problems. It removes your 70-persistent-net.rules and unload / load each network driver, which causes a regeneration of that file with the correct configuration</p>
