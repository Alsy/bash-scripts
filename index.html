        <h3>Welcome to my bash scripts collection.</h3>

<p>This a collection of my bash scripts. Some of them are written for personal use, so they're adapted to my needs, feel free to modify them. </p>


<h3>backup.sh</h3>

<p>It was my backup script for a while. Quite simple, just some rsync over different folders, with logs. But in my case I had first to mount my device.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
